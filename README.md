# SoulDust

SoulDust is a story-based puzzle/RPG top-down Adventure and action game set in 2151, 100 years after a nuclear war.
2058, society began to heal itself, however, humans were not the only thing to grow. Sentient humanoid creatures inhabited Earth as well, and humans (being a hostile race) declared war on them despite being heavily outnumbered. After 16 years of petty fighting, they joined hands to build the glorious city of New Castro supported by Akari Labs, a research facility ran by ones of the Akari bloodline.
Starting out, you plan as a confused Nix in the year 2150, who has no memories and nothing more than scraps in his pockets to get his identity. He wakes up in the mountains, only to find an adventurer named Caesar, who takes him to safety.
A year passes, not a day passes that Nix doesn’t think about his past, sometimes he has dreams that he has a strong connection to, but like most dreams, they vanish in the sands of time.
